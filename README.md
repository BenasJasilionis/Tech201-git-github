* Lets create our Markdown file
* Use "mkdir" to create a directory
* Use "cd" <directory name> to move into the directory (can use tab to autocomplete)
* Check which directory you are in by using command "pwd"
* To clone the git directory into local machine, copy repository link
* Then on the local terminal, use "git clone" <url> and press enter
* Double check by using "ls" to check directories
(Can use command "clear" to clean out the terminal)
* Navigate into new directory using "cd"
* Using "ls" should view the one file there - README.md
